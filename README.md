# ! Updating current version from flat file to sqlite
starting November 8th 2024, any commit might have stray code of flat file vs sqlite3 while we migrate this trough out the whole file, any comits duuring this transition might break the code
after it all done i will release v1.38

# Build in Python v3.10.10

After some time messing with lora, i camme to the opinion that i did not like the web interface mmush to monitor my lore node, nor did i want my phone to like be connected to it 24/7 So as a result and some tinkering in Python we came to this litle prodject. Granted i am not a super python coder, to be fair started using it like a year or so ago. So help always welcome to make it even bether!

To Do
* Add Node 2 Node Chat
* Add MMaybe some graphs per node; not sure if it needed but can look in to at some point
* Add Config options (tough not sure yet how...)
* Add Cashe for chat, so if you close it you get least last x lines back
